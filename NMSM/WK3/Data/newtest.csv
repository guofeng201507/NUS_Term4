tr858,8/25/2014,revtrain20248,3,"Way too expensive for the quality & quantity of food you get. I had purchased a groupon & we went last Friday. The place was not very busy which was surprising for a Friday night but according to some of the other yelp reviews, not unusual. 

We ordered the calamari & fried artichokes for our appetizers. The calamari was $13 & the portion was tiny. The fried artichokes were either canned or jarred artichokes which I could not believe. At a restaurant like that, it's completely ridiculous to use any kind of canned ingredients. My husband got the veal with mushrooms & I got one of their specials, Chilean Sea Bass. My husbands veal was nothing special & the sauce had a weird texture to it. My sea bass was good but the accompanying side of orzo with different veggies in some type of sauce was very boring & unimaginative. 

Very forgettable meal & we won't be going back. I can think of at least 3 other Italian restaurants that blow this place out of the water.",positive
tr858,8/29/2014,revtrain20249,4,"I really enjoyed this restaurant. The service was great, and the woman serving us was beyond friendly and helpful. Their garlic bites are amazing, and they have a pretty extensive menu. The dish I ordered was great, and you get quite a bit for your money, with the main dishes at least. Also got a canoli to take home, and it was delicious as well. 

Definitely recommend it.",positive

My cioppino was perfect, my fianc?? s vongole was delish,  the carppacio was divine.  They had great customer service and super helpful with the menu...I love this place!!!",positive
tr858,10/1/2014,revtrain20251,2,"Pretty good service, friendly staff, not all that comfortable and the sauce is very acidic and a weird texture to it.  Just not what I thought it would be, tried it a second time and decided it was not for me.",negative
tr858,10/15/2014,revtrain20252,1,"The owners of this establishment are the strangest, most bizarre I've ever seen they watch you from a distance and they yelled at my date telling her that she did not know how to eat her food properly because she asked for crushed red pepper. I would eat there much more if they weren't so rude. 



Also, another experience I had there when a friend had a Groupon you could tell the lady owner was not happy and we even presented the coupon before we ordered, as if that should make any difference on how they prepare it.



I've never felt a more bizarre dynamic in a food establishment in my life.",negative
tr858,11/2/2014,revtrain20253,2,"When you first walk into the restaurant, you're not even welcomed. You're stared at and then the guy asks if he can help you. We were there for a birthday dinner and we were still waiting for a few guests to show up. We asked to have some bread and the waiter rudely says that we need to order dinner before we get any bread. I've never heard of that before! Why would we be there for a birthday reservation and not order dinner?! So then the waiter says that he'll be back when the rest of our party shows up. When the last person got there he came and rambled off the specials very fast and we barely saw him the rest of the night. The other reviews are true when they say the owners seem to stand in the corner and stare at you. 



The food was ok, nothing special. It took FOREVER to come. Then we waited forever to get our check. The waiter never offered us drinks. We were only served water. Maybe if we had gotten some bread early on we would have ordered wine to go with it. 



Maybe this place should treat all their new guests as well as they seemed to cater to their regulars. Definitely not going back.",negative

tr858,11/8/2014,revtrain20255,2,"The food was good but the hostess who I believe is one of the owners was rude. We had our two kids and she gave them each a twisty toy but when we asked if they had kids menu she said ""no this is a fine dining restaurant,"" in a smug way. It's not fine dining if you have to tell people it's fine dining. We actually dine out at fine restaurants often and they cater to children just fine. She was condescending in implying that a fine dining restaurant wouldn't offer a kids menu. I hardly ever write reviews but i thought she was rude and it would have been fine if she had just said they didnt have a kids menu but to imply that such a nice restaurant would never offer such a thing was just plain rude, especially when she doesn't know what she's talking about. The waiter took a long time to come take our order. I finished my plate and they didn't pre-bus the table and take my plate away. We will not return.",negative

tr858,12/21/2014,revtrain20259,1,"I am adding my comments to tag with JANET N'S comment on 12/21/14, I was  the person who brought the Groupon. Had the Waiter taken our coupons when we offered them to him at the beginning of service, we all could have avoided the embarrassment and humiliation we endured.  The so called Mrs. Manager /Hostess was rude, and both Mgr. and Waiter continued to act inappropriately by returning to our table to voice their opinions to us. In addition, the Waiter placed an 18% service charge (mind you we are only a party of 4) on our check, assuming that he deserved it. Two more negatives: 1). The 7 up we ordered, was never replaced as the BAR ran out of 7 up-it was 5 pm when the restaurant opened that they ran out of soda?  2). The restaurant did not serve fresh grated Parmesan cheese. That was shocking considering the price point and the theme of the restaurant indicating Italian food served.  Not a great Christmas Dinner experience!",negative

Sure would have been nice to know before wasting an hour of my time to drive there. Their prices are outrageous for the portions, too.

My favorite dishes are:

Garlic Knots - A must have for anyone who eats here.  Think pizza dough with butter and garlic tied into a knot.

Pizza - I like the 2 slice cheese lunch special when I'm in a hurry.

Baked Ziti - Unbelievably good.....large serving.  I definitely need a nap after eating this dish.

I highly recommend this place especially if you have cravings for good east coast Italian food. Although these guys have been here a while, they have not strayed from their roots.

That's right, I'm pretty certain some minor deities were involved.).  Sigh.  Not to mention inhaling the chocolate chip & ricotta-filled cannolis from their in-house bakery.  Oh & just in case you're curious, their toothy old school deli sandwiches are nothing to sneer at either.  Sigh.  [drool]



Yup.  I'm so far gone that I'm actually contemplating a trip to Lost Wages just so I can root around in a ziti-garlic-knot-cannoli-induced haze.  I wonder if they use FedEx?

The quality and taste of the food at each location is remarkably good.



These folks know chicken.



The best thing is feeling of being full without the guilt for eating at a fast food.

And unlike some other places, the chicken doesn't need to be overly coated and deep fired (not that there's anything wrong with that) to be tasty.



I really enjoy the food here.",positive

Chargrilled chicken served in a variety of ways, along with a surprising number of side dishes (for a fast food chain, anyway) that is tasty and good for you AND your wallet. 



My personal favorites are the Pollo Bowl (chicken, beans, rice, pico de gallo, onions and cilantro all done up nicely in a bowl) and the Twice Grilled Burrito.  Muy Bueno!

tr860,7/9/2009,revtrain20269,2,The chicken is alright. The commercial is very misleading because my chicken did not look like the one on TV. The sides were alright and the salsa bar was good until I witnessed a 3 year old girl slobbering all over the spoon and vigorously dipping her infested hands in to the sauce/salsa containers. Very unappealing to say the least. I told the child's mother and the store manager about the blatant condiment violation and they both looked at me with the intent to trick me that they did not speak English.

tr860,2/10/2012,revtrain20274,3,"After recieving some coupons in the mail = .99 Fish Taco's, my interest was peeked & I decided to make it my destination on my walk. I got there at lunch time and there was a line halfway into the seating area but it wasnt a long wait to order, maybe 5 min.



I had previously looked at some reviews here and because of THAT, I ordered a small bowl of Chicken Tortilla soup ($2.99) and the before mentioned fish taco (Reg $1.99...wt coupon .99). The Total wt tax came to $4.30.



This is a few steps up from Taco Bell and the plates I saw being served looked really good & healthy. My taco was very small and not a good value at the reduced fare of .99. It was good but the Fish Taco's for .99 at Long John Silvers are way better & bigger. Now when it comes to soup, I am spoiled rotten, as I worked at a condo and the Chef there was a Pro and in fact was once Tommy Lasorda's personal Chef, and the soup this guy made was the MOST AWESOME EVER!!



The Tortilla soup was NOT as good as reviewers made it out to be. First off the portion didnt match the price of $3. I have had Campbell's Chunky Mexican Chk Soup ($1.50) that is a bigger portion for less and packs more overall flavor. It was ""OK"" at best and did have some nice chunks of chicken but not worth $3.



I'm not writing this place off by any means and will probably go back using it again as a destination on a walk one day and try the Chicken Tortilla Salad. But for value's sake, I could have paid another dollar & gone to lunch at Buffet @ Asia (see previous review here) & had more of a choice of dishes & all you can eat.



Way better than Taco Bell or Del Taco thats for sure!!",positive

On a recent visit, my El Tradicional burrito had a pretty nice sized bone in the middle of it. Yes, I found yet another bone in my chicken from two different chains now.



This time, instead of being a big chunk of bone, it was a nice sized rib by the looks of it.



I tried calling the store to let the manager know their staff should be a little more careful, no answer. I know how busy they get during the day, so I figured I would call a different time. No answer. A different day, before the daily lunch rush. No answer. Fill out a form on the corporate website, receive only an autoresponder email. Next visit in, I brought the bone and receipt, manager was too busy to step away.

I love the salsa bar with its variety, and the cashier was amazingly friendly.

EPL has never let me down on flavor, it's consistency for service, and it's atmosphere.

I'm extremely glad that my friend invited me and a few of other friends to come and visit this gem!



The decor is ""old-wester-Vegas"" as this pub has been around for quite a few years living through the ups and downs of Vegas and the growth of its West side, where this pub is located.



The food was EXTREMELY affordable--we're talking $4.00 for a full platter! It is more of a diner fare with a few upgrades. The service is extremely quick, the drink selection is vast and also affordable. Bartender was very good and waitress made us feel at home. I loved their BLT sandwish on sour dough bread, and their take on ""quasadillas"" stuffed with a plethora of meats and vegetables. Their yummy fries come in different flavors and seasonings, my favorite being ""cajun.""



This was a very good experience from start to finish. I could understand that even on a week night it was packed. Highly recommend this place!

Do not eat here.  I am a fool.  No matter how appetizing bar food may seem at the moment, you don't want theirs.  I ate over 2 hours ago, and my stomach ache has yet to find an upper limit.  It just keeps getting worse.



Ugh.  Did you see that?  Before I could even finish this review, I just ran off to the bathroom and violently vomited.  I'm in hell right now.  I don't think it's food poisoning.  My boyfriend and I shared our turkey club sandwich and onion rings, and he's okay.  They probably just never clean out their fryer, or something



I mean, the food tasted alright (the first time around, not the second!), but I will never go back now.  Not even for a drink.

tr861,10/9/2013,revtrain20298,3,"My perspective is from die-hard N.Y. Giants fan and all around bar fan. This bar is only one of two bars in town that cater to 'NY Giants' fans. As you read this review, keep in mind that this was an early game but this is football season in Vegas and I have been to bars for early games and they were as busy as if it were Monday Night Football.



CONS:

This place is not advertized to the general public as a NYGiants themed bar in the Las Vegas area. I found out about this place through a buddy of mine. The reason they can't advertise as being a Giants bar is because one of the criteria required by the Las Vegas Review Journal is that you cater only to the team support and not show any other game while your team is playing. But, they do, they have every game on TV and they display the Giants game on the big screen with sound. This in and of itslef is not that big of a deal because there is a decent amount of Giants fans in the place, but there are also plenty of fans of other teams too and that kind of takes away from the whole concept.



They raffle prizes at half-time but they are freebies they get from vendors and none Giants related. 



The bartender wears a Philidelphia Eagles jersey every week. 



Smoking is allowed and ventilation is definitely lacking.





PROS:

Because its definitely a locals place, the price is right. The service is always excellent. The staff is welcoming. The customers are friendly and the place is set up pretty nicely. The menu is pretty good. When I go to an early game I have the stake and eggs with hashbrowns and choice of toast for $9. It's absolutely excellent!, Well cooked and delicious. The beer always cold and on point. I'd already had breakfast so I just had the potato chip fries. These chips are very good. 



CONCLUSION:

As a bar it gets four stars but I only go during football season to watch the Giants when their not already on TV so that's all I have to go by. I gave the place three stars instead of two as a 'Giants' bar because it is as close to a Giants bar as any other bar gets in this town and beggers can't be choosers. I'd give it four stars if they were a strickly Giants bar, and five if the bartender didn't wear an Eagles jersey. If you're a football fan you understand.",positive

It took over 30 minuets for us to get our salad, and if you have ever been to an Olive Garden, that's the easiest thing to get. Now if that wasn't bad enough, there wasn't any dressing on the salad, then to top it off we sat there for 20 more minuets after we were done waiting for a bill.

The service is always wonderful & the food is always good, fresh, and leaves you full and satisfied. I love the complimentary breadsticks (unlimited), they are sooo good and are always hot and fresh! They taste even better if u order some alfredo sauce to dip them in. 



My favorites: 

1. The Tour Of Italy: Delicious. Great 1st choice if you've never been there before and don't know whether u want to try the spaghetti or the alfredo.It comes with a slice of lasagna, some fettucine alfredo, and some chicken parmigiana. Very good!! 

2.Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo: Really satisfying, I ordered mine with extra chicken (it doesn't come wit very much.) 

3. Chicken And Dumpling Soup: Yum! the dumplings are sooo good! 



I never really mind waiting for my food, I usually try to dine at places like this when I want to spend time with my family, friends, or a little one on one time with my husband. As long as the food is hot and fresh, and the service is great, i have no complaints!! :]] If I wanted fast food type of italian food, I would go to a fast food type restaurant, like Fazoli's.",positive

The Olive Garden has become one of those places where you know the food is going to be good everytime you go.  They don't move their menu around every 6 months like alot of places do.  They offer consistency over variety.  That's not to say the food is boring, quite the opposite.  The Olive Garden has found a niche that works for them and I for one appreciate it.



On occasion they will bring some new dishes from their culinary school that might be worth a try.  They also do the same thing with their seasonal desserts.  Which reminds me, if you haven't tried the pumpkin cheesecake ye, WTF are you waiting for.  That thing is delicious!",positive
tr862,12/27/2011,revtrain20315,1,"We were in town for a vacation and decided to go to this OG to celebrate a birthday.  First, let me say that the waiter was not very friendly.  He made mention that our table was the last one and he could leave after us.  Hi, Rude!  He got drinks mixed up for our group and poured different drinks into people's glasses.  Honestly, I would recommend a drug test because the behavior had chronic written all over him.  When passing the drinks out, he actually told someone ""can you pass this down because I am not going to try going behind the seats"".  HELLO, it is your job!  And if the seats are too close to the wall, then move the table out so the wait staff can get behind people.



When the waitress asked if we wanted marinara dipping sauce for our bread sticks, she should have mentioned that it was for a fee.  We were surprised to find that each one was around $8!  Again, these places tend to nickel and dime you for everything.  Had we known this, we certainly would not have ordered it.



The last straw was when they came out to sing happy birthday, they brought out a small dish with whipped cream, drizzled with chocolate and a candle in it.  REALLY?  We spend a good amount of money and they couldn't spring for a REAL dessert?  It was laughable and became the butt of a running joke amongst us for the rest of our trip.  I mean really, who does that, whipped cream with a candle in it?

Considering how extremely busy they were, the wait wasn't all that bad, screaming babies in the waiting area aside. 



Once we sat down and got our server's attention he, the manager and even the busboy were all very attentive. I give the staff here props for checking up on us regularly and keeping the refills and breadsticks coming. 



The food is still eh. I would prefer soup, salad and breadsticks, but I decided on the peach chicken thing and it was just too sweet and weird. Even weirder that it was served with a pasta topped with alfredo sauce. Just a weird combination for me.

tr862,7/25/2013,revtrain20328,3,"So overall, we had a lovely experience at this location last evening. The guest service was absolutely the most wonderful I've had in quite some time! Before your meal, they serve a basket full of breadsticks which are pretty tasty. For our appetizer, we had chose the ""create a sampler Italiano"" option in which we picked calamari, fried mozzarella, and pork ravioli. The calamari was tender, lightly breaded, and fried served with both a parmesan and marinara sauce. The fried mozzarella was absolutely delicious and the pork ravioli was pretty decent.

Before the entr??e, they give you the choice between a soup or salad. I ordered a Caesar salad and my husband ordered the Zuppa Toscana which is a type of creamy potato soup served with greens. The soup was absolutely spectacular! Unfortunately, quite a few pieces of my romaine lettuce in the Caesar salad were mushy and overdressed. 

My husband ordered the Cheese Ravioli and enjoyed it. For my dish, I ordered the grilled sausage and peppers Rustica. The consistency was perfect...the penne was al dente, peppers were tender, and the Italian sausage was flavorful. However, I felt that they went slightly shy on seasoning and spices which I adjusted with table salt (and I don't really do this at a restaurant too often.)

The waiter was absolutely delightful and packed up our food for us. The portions are quite generous so you will most likely find yourself taking home leftovers. He generously also packed some wonderful mint chocolate candies. Overall, we had a nice experience.",positive

Each time i go here i usually get my chicken alfredo. Nothing special but the past couple of my experiences i get the never ending pasta bowl.



The pasta is ok, sauce is too thick in my opinion and when i bring home leftovers it doesn't age too well. after 5 to 10 hours it doesnt taste appetizing and you don't feel like eating it.

The soup and salad is tasty i enjoy it more than the pasta.



Service is good as well. We walked in for lunch on a monday and it wasn't full so we got a table quite quickly, and we didn't have to sit down.  Our waiter was fast, friendly and very informative. He told us new menu items and what he personally liked. He was very clean and very professional. Great service.

They are a drain on the income of the company that owns them because they can't justify the prices they charge, thus less people are going in year after year.  The food is bland and overpriced, example, $13.00 for spaghetti and meatballs, $16 for lasagna????  Your food better be damn good at those prices, and Olive Garden is not even close.  There are so many restaurants that have better food and lower prices in Vegas that it's just a matter of time before Olive Garden is no more....one caveat:   the servers are really good, they try their best to do everything right, I can't fault them for the company's food and pricing problems.",negative

  My first impression upon walking in was not good due to the bad smell. Smelled like stale Parmesan cheese mixed with the body odor of several people that havent taken a bath in a month.  I sat down and was given menus. The menus had dried food smeared all over them from previous customers. 

  The waiter had cookie crumbs on his shirt, and what appeared to be salad dressing stains on front of shirt. 

  I was tempted to walk out, but decided what the hell, lets use this gift card up. 

 Ordered the special   unlimited bread sticks, soup, or salad, and pasta with sauce for me and wife. (9.99 each)

 Waiter brought a basket with a whopping 3 bread sticks. I got the salad, wife got soup. The salad tasted pretty good, but mostly had just 3 green salad leafs. The rest was mostly salad stems, onions, croutons and other junk. They give you a big bowl of salad and it is mostly stems. I could have asked for more salad, but I might have to argue about not finishing what was brought to me. 

   The pasta seemed to have been sitting around for a while before I arrived. It was dehydrated and not fresh. had to use knife and fork to cut it up. The marinara sauce had an off smell and taste to it. I could only manage to force myself to take a few bites. What crap!!!! The back ground smell, and the pasta smell and taste almost had my stomach churning. 

    the fun part was when the waiter brought the check. The total was 28.39, I gave him the 25 dollar gift certificate, and 3.40 in cash. had to wait for 15 minutes for my change., and waiter tried offering us dessert, which was included. I declined desert, as the deserts were probably crap too. I took my penny of change and departed with out leaving a tip. Needless to say I wont be coming back there.

Tuscan soup has a little kick to it. It's made in a thin creamy broth with ground sausage, kale, potatoes & delicious seasonings. They add grated cheese (at your preference), which makes it even better. Always gotta get their Peach Bellini as well! Bomb!



The beau got the Chicken Alfredo. Not a big fan of Alfredo but I always sneak a bite. 



They have some newer items on the menu. There's a special-- buy one now, take one to go for $12.99. Which is a pretty good deal for all the leftover Lovin fatties!



Olive Garden has one of the best Moscatos I've ever tasted. Also I tried their Roscato, which is a delicately fizzy sweet red wine. One of my new found obsessions. & I'm not a big Red wine drinker either.

The chicken and shrimp carbonara, lasagna, and chicken flatbread never disappoints.



The chicken parmagiana is good %90 of the time, but be careful of the tough cutlets that can be churned out of here sometimes. The calamari and spicy calamari is great when you dine in, but beware of tough or fishy pieces if you order takeout at night. The same goes for the stuffed mushrooms, they're flavorful and tender on a good night.



 I'd say the chicken alfredo has a lower success rate of being as good. The alfredo sauce can be sticky and clumpy at times.",positive

I was given an attitude about them forgetting my drink. Then, my sandwich was wrong and I didn't ask them to remark it. I simple asked for the pickles they forgot. I was screamed at because my pickles would come out of the cashiers pay?! Other employees stepped in and apologized but I was already mad at that point. Went back to the table and told my husband we were leaving! The cashier sat right outside the door and took a smoke break. We had to basically climb over her to leave. Then she thought it would be a good idea to call me a b**** as we got into our truck! I'm sorry I asked for pickles I paid for & you forgot my drink... I would have happily paid for the drink but you were busy being rude because you rang everything out separately. Costing me more money... As far as your rude comments,  I'll be adding them to my military wife blog and telling everyone not to bother eating at this location.

As for the sandwiches the hubby always gets the french dip (pretty good choice) sometimes he'll surprise me and go with the beef n cheddar. I love the onion roll it comes on.

My chicken burrito.. I can't remember which one I ended up going with, had tons of quac in it.. I like guac, but I couldn't taste anything else in the burrito. So meh.

I like Rubio's tacos. They are fresh and I have never had a bad experience with what I tend to order. I rotate between their original fish taco platter, street tacos platter, and grilled fish platter. I've never had the burritos, quesadillas, etc. On my last visit I had the street tacos platter (carne asada, chicken, and carnitas). They were all tasty and well prepared. Not fats or gristle, just good meat.



The chips are nice to dip in the beans and the numerous salsas you can get at the salsa bar. 



Lastly, this Rubio's is clean, the employees were very nice to me and my mother (and made sure my mother did not get any guac in her meal). Overall, Rubio's is still a fave of mine, especially this location.",positive

We ordered 3 fish tacos each, which was more than enough since they were pretty big, and a small fountain drink for only $12.26. Now that was a cheap dinner!

They were all good but the carnitas was my favorite.

First off I love fish, and fish is their speciality, so the relationship is now mutual. Getting a delicious Ono Burrito after a hard workout at the gym is a great pick me up. They have your typical steak and chicken burrito options if your not in the mood for fish, and these are also great. There is alway some new flavor on the menu to try. There food items are not swimming in grease so you wont feel like you swallowed a lead ball when your finished chowing down. If its your first time I recommend the Blackened Ono Burrito. If you want some shrimp, give the Mesquite shrimp burrito a go. This location is next to Whole foods on lake mead off the 95 exit.

I had the Mahi Mahi burrito. There was delightfully flaky mahi mahi, rice, roasted corn, red onions, guacamole all wrapped in a delight flour tortilla.

The shrimp verde taco is also good, but I'd personally request it on corn tortillas. They're currently promoting a langostino burrito that sounds tasty, but the fish tacos are reliably large and tasty.

I only had the country scramble or somethin.

Girlfriend was excited for the pumpkin bread but didnt eat half of it, not sure why.. only thing she liked was the feeling of the place, small, open, blackboard specials. Did not feel Las Vegasy AT ALL, more like a place in the mid west that would be on Diners Drive Ins and Dives.

It doesn't look like anything fancy from the outside, and the inside decor looks like something your grandma decorated, not very modern, but homey and sweet.  The staff fits the decor as well.. very warm, very lovely.  The menu is full of culinary delights and fun concoctions that get your mouth watering and leave you wishing there were 20 people with you, so you could try one of everything!  Fresh ingredients, and 38 different omelets to choose from.  Each breakfast comes with your choice of toast, english muffin, pumpkin nut, or banana nut bread, or tortillas.  I opted for the banana nut bread, which was piping hot and delicious!  Choose from lobster, gulf shrimp, avocado, cherizo, among a ton of other proteins!  We ordered the Eggs Benedict Lobster, and the Lobster fest omelet.  Both were fantastic!  The benedict was rich, full of fresh, tender lobster, and cooling avocado, in a rich hollandaise, and perfectly poached eggs.  The Lobster Fest omelet was fresh, clean and light.. but a TON of it!  Very very good!  I already know what I'll be trying next!  They feature a Flatlanders Special with raw liver, parsnips, grunion lips, gardenia petals, and mint ice cream!  Probably not something I'd get everytime with a price tag of $69... but definitely a bucket list item!!  I'd also love to try ""The Bugsy"", featuring tender chunks of roast beef in an Italian red sauce.  Please make it a point to stop by next time you're in Vegas!

(Only one coupon per table, they said, although that wasn't specified on the coupon.) So our friends had to sit at a table next to us and we shouted at each other to have a conversation. Ridiculous.



Plus their highly touted banana bread reeks of artificial banana flavoring, not fresh bananas; and their special potatoes (served instead of standard hash browns) are like thick, hard, and slightly greasy potato chips.

This is my first experience here where I received less than stellar service so I will not dwell on it.

I was satisfied that it was clean, specials were communicated on the chalk board as soon as you walk in, and everyone is really friendly.



What I really enjoy here is the basic breakfast since it's one of my favorite meals, I got the ham and eggs with toast.  Sure what I choose is a basic breakfast but I loved how it's all freshly made and the ham was cooked well and not overly salty.  I've eaten here with friends who've gotten the ""Kitchen Sink Omelet"" and various sandwiches and everyone has always left full and with boxes for the leftovers.



If you're up for a clean, friendly, and delicious breakfast/lunch place with friends I'm sure anyone can find something on the menu.  I've already added this to one of my options on weekend mornings.",positive
tr865,4/29/2012,revtrain20416,4,"We arrived with a open attitude. As usual- Yelp had some very negative and some very positive comments. We are new residents to Las Vegas after moving from Seattle. 



The restaurant is located in a strip mall of Summerlin- about 12 miles from the strip. The restaurant is family owned with beautiful pictures of the kids. This is definately not your chain restaurant. 



The service was exceptional with the waitress filling my coke about 4 times. The meal started with a huge slice of homemade pumpkin loaf that was great.



I had the kitchen sink. It was very large and fresh. It was absolutely huge with lots of cheese and very fresh. There were a few strange things like pieces of meatball. I think it had about 5 eggs and I had to bring half home.



My wife had the shrimp omelette. The shrimp was probably frozen but still very tasty. There was a ton of cheese.



We did not like the potato chips- sliced potatoes with skin on. The fries were kinda mediocre. Next time we order the hash browns.



The total bill was $25.00 which was very reasonable for excellent food and great service.



Atmosphere: Community diner with a ton of local people- lots of elderly also. Not too many kids so it was a very quiet and pleasant Sunday breakfast.



Overall: Excellent value and a great community feel- a definite return visit.

The staff didn't seem too friendly but perhaps they are more used to serving the mostly an older crowd and were put off by all my kids. 



As far as the food we ordered the biscuits and gravy with eggs and potatoes. It was not good and worse my breakfast potatoes were green. The waffle and french toast breakfast plates were just ok not worth the price. The only on who enjoyed his food was my son who ordered pancakes with chocolate chips. They are not cooked in like other places they just threw a ton of chips on top so he had a big melted mess of chocolate everywhere. 



I'm pretty sad I did not get the experience everyone else seems to rave about. Normally I give places with really good reviews a second chance in case I came on a bad day.

The Omelet House doesnt care about that nonsense. They are proud to be from Chicago and dont  try to hide it. All of their decor is Chicago based and I was in heaven.



Ok so how was the food? It was awesome! There was two of us and we split three dishes. The daughter had eggs Benedict and I had the loch ness. We split the waffle plate. The daughter said the Benedict was delicious and loved the waffle. 



My loch ness was pretty good but kinda gross at the same time.  I love seafood and I love eggs/breakfast dishes but have never tried to put the two together? Had to give it a try. 



The Shrimp was fresh but the shrimp flavor didnt mix well with the eggs and the avocado didnt help blend the flavors together. My suggestion for it would be to add a creamy white sauce to help blend the three contrasting flavors together.



The wait staff was top notch always willing to make a suggestion and refill your drink. Jen was our server and she was awesome and knew the dishes well enough to answer the many questions I had as well as to make suggestions bases on my questions.

$7.89 for dry greasy eggs that my daughter didnt finish because they were poor quality.



My family does not eat PORK. Upcharge for turkey sausage, no turkey bacon! We will not ever return to this place ever. Their prices are already high enough, in my opinion, to absorb the cost of a single tiny Jimmy Dean turkey sausage patty. $3.99 for a single patty of turkey sausage... WOW! definitely not customer friendly pricing strategy. 



The server was nice, and friendly, and understanding, but agreed that the place was not kid or customer friendly. Had we not already ordered and received drinks, we would have left without ordering.

They offer a pretty wide/diverse selection of omelets plus some other breakfast dishes & lunch items.  Despite the name, we noticed that they had dinner menus there too.



We stopped in on a Saturday morning around 10am, and there was a 15 minute wait for a table.  It has a family owned business feel; everything and everybody has a purpose.  There were quite a few families with children who were all well behaved.  Service was no frills and to the point, but it was difficult to get water refills.



Bf was super happy about his omelet, the #20 Polish Omelet that was stuffed with cheddar & polish sausage.  The ham & egg plate was better than it looked.

I've eaten at this location with my mother several times, as she enjoys talking with the  owner's family, who are from the old country (Italy/Sicily). I've never been terribly impressed with the food, and the spuds/fries are just awful. 



I hadn't been back for over a year, and I was nearby and decided to give the place another chance. Big mistake. I ordered one of the cheeseburgers and went to take a bite when I noticed tiny green flecks in the interior of the bun. I inspected the bun more thoroughly, and saw a larger (about 1/4 inch diameter) patch of light green mold. 



I called my server over and informed her of the problem and that I would not be paying for the meal. She was very apologetic and offered to replace my meal with something else from the menu. My appetite was gone at this point, so I elected to leave. As I was gathering my things, I saw my server showing the manager (one of the managing family) my burger. The manager actually said to my server: ""I don't know what that is, but it isn't mold."" 



Really? I know what moldy bread looks like when I see it, and I'm sure as heck not going to eat it!! I just hope that the manager didn't take my bill out of the server's check.",negative
tr865,9/20/2013,revtrain20438,3,"Pretty good hidden little spot for breakfast in Summerlin.  Really, it is kinda hidden.  If I didn't see the bunch of people coming out of this little place on a Sunday morning I might have never thought to look in this corner of the strip mall!  It's located in the Smith's shopping center off of Rampart and Lake Mead.  



Seems like this Omelet House is owned by a family that is from Chicago, so the decor reflects as much.  I have no problem with that, the home of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Hot Dog (one of my fav sinful snacks) are OK with me.  It was super busy on a Sunday morning, good mix of locals and what seemed to be a bunch of church goers.  Praise be!  Hallelujah!  I got the Spirit inside me!  Sorry, sorry...too many Madea movies lately.



After a short wait we were seated by our nice hostess.  I'm thinking she may be one of the owners, her native Chicago accent was present!  A few short minutes later our waitress presented herself and brought us our drinks of water and coffee.  



The menu at The Omelet House is almost typical with lots of other breakfast joints here in Vegas.  Lots and lots of breakfast items, with a mix of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and soups.  I know this place does dinner as well, but I didn't get to go through that menu so we'll just focus on breakfast and lunch.  I really like how this Omelet House has a sprinkling of Chicago in their menu, they have some good looking stuff.  Specialties like Chicago dogs, and Italian beef sandwiches can be had for your meal.  There are a number of omelettes and breakfast specials to choose from, it can be overwhelming.



I stuck with what I like from these breakfast joints, a Club Sandwich.  Yes, a Club Sandwich.  In this case at The Omelet House, a California Club.  Comes with turkey, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on white or wheat bread.  Also a side of potato spuds (think chips), fries, soup or salad.  I don't know what it is about a Club Sandwich that I like so much.  Might be the nostalgia of when we used to go to restaurants as a kid my Mom would always order a Club Sandwich and share some with me.  Might be that 3rd layer of bread that made a Club Sandwich seem so darn special.



Anyway, the Club Sandwich at The Omelet House was good.  A nice sized portion, big looking sandwich.  The bread was nice and toasted, the veggies were fresh, and the fries were tasty.  Not the best Club Sandwich I've ever had because this one needed more mayo (lots please), and some bacon!  This sandwich would have been off-the-cuff with some crispy bacon!  It was just missing a punch of salt.



The wifey had a corned beef omelet with potato spuds.  Large omelet!  Very tasty too.  The salty corned beef went great with the delicate eggs.  Add some Tabasco and it was some good eats.  But I have had better omelettes elsewhere.  Breakfasts also come with your choice of toast, english muffin, pumpkin nut bread, banana nut bread, or tortillas.  We got the banana nut bread and it was yummy.  Not too dry, lots of bananas!  



It's a tad pricy to eat at The Omelet House I'm guessing because it is Summerlin after all.  Much of the menu ranges from the $7 - $10 area for entree type dishes.  So if you're a cheapy look at the menu accordingly.  Service is fast since you will probably be eating with a million other people.  But they are nice for the most part.  Probably be back here again for a meal, just wouldn't be my top choice.",positive

tr865,2/4/2014,revtrain20446,3,"I was surprised about how busy this place is, given it was breakfast and on a Sunday, however, it just never looked that busy to me from the outside. We went on around 10 am - the wait was 20 minutes for two people. However, there were two open seats at the counter with no waiting so we sat there. They told me that it was always that busy on weekend mornings. 



I had the St. Paddy's Day Omelet. Per the waitress the omelets were the best thing to get, made with six eggs. It was a little under $11. It was huge and could feed two people. The St. Paddy's Day omelet contained corned beef hash and cheddar cheese.  The omelet itself wasn't that impressive, other than the size, it tasted okay but a true omelet should be fluffy and a little soft in the center. This had more than consistency of a frittata, eggs were overcooked and was more dense than fluffy. 



The I picked the spuds that went with it. I think that they cut potatoes on a mandolin and fried them.  There was no vegetables, such as onion and green pepper like you may expect in a country potato, the slices were inconsistent as to thickness which in turn made them inconsistent as to how they were cooked. Some were really crispy like a potato chip and other thicker slices were undercooked and greasy in the center. 



Also, the entree came with banana bread, this was tasty, not sure if it was homemade or a box mix though. Some place you can easily tell box mix but either I was really hungry or my palette was off that I just wasn't sure.  



There is a 2 for 1 coupon in the entertainment book up to $7.00 off. So for two people with two omelets our total was around $18.00, I also had coffee which was $2.50. 



I debated between the two and three stars, the food was ""meh"" but the portion size was good and the waitress was very accommodating and nice. Also, she was relatively attentive considering how busy they were and it appeared that they were understaffed.

He stated that its because the side order is a bigger portion, well geez... I didn't think that was necessary for a 7 year old girl AFTER I just asked him for suggestions on menu items that have SMALLER portions.

My husband, son, and I went to have breakfast one Saturday morning.  We arrived and were seated at approximately 8 am.  I had a meeting and had to leave around 9.  I ordered Eggs Benedict and at 8:45 our food was finally delivered.  The plates were too hot to touch, suggesting the food had sat under the heat lamp for quite some time.  When I cut into my eggs they were hard cooked.  I tried to flag down the waitress, but had to wait about 10 minutes to finally get her attention.  When she finally came over I asked her to please remove it from the bill.  She told me if I ate even one bite she was unable to.  I hadn't eaten even a bite.  The owner came over and gave me a $7 off card for our next visit.  I thanked him but told him I just wanted the meal taken off and didn't need a coupon off our next meal.  It was a simple mistake and unfortunately didn't have time to have the eggs remade.  No harm, no foul.  He insisted I take the coupon.  I had to leave so my husband paid the bill.  Later in the day I looked at the receipt and saw I was charged for the Eggs Benedict after all!  I went back to the restaurant and tried to explain the situation.  The owner came up to the cashier and said he had given me a $7 off coupon.  The improperly prepared food had cost $10.99.  I asked for her to refund the money plus tax.  The owner took $10 out of his pocket and tossed it on the counter and asked for his coupon back and rudely suggested that I order something else IF I come back.  As I turned to leave the cashier said to the owner, loudly enough for me to hear, that she couldn't believe I was making such a big deal over $10 and that if I couldn't afford to go out to eat then I shouldn't go out to eat.  I left this restaurant feeling really horrible.  Twice a month for the past 3 years we have eaten there, we have spent about $40 per meal.

I'm surprised more people don't know about this place. the dining room is large. We went on a Sunday morning about 9:30 and it was half empty but there were plenty of people both coming and going, so they were busy. The crowd was mainly older folks but it's because it's location is so close to Sun City.

Open 24/7, all donuts fresh fried and glazed. 



I walked in and looked at the display rack of fresh donuts, literally saw them glistening with their generous freshly just glazed icing. 



$7.99 for a dozen, well 14 donuts to be exact, not sure if that is standard or just because I walked in with two nice big plump donuts of my own? Anyhow that is a steal for fresh, moist, melt in your mouth donuts at 2am. 



Service is great, I mean really I don't expect mind blowing service from a donut shop, much less at 2am. Also does not take much skill or thrill to fill a box with donuts. 



The gentleman working this particular early morning shift had lots of spunk and vigor. He is one with tons of personality, joking and told me my total was 7 million dollars, you know those funny types. Really refreshing considering he works graveyard!

Hadn't been to a Winchell's in a long time so bought a dozen (yes, their dozen is actually 14 which is nice).  Tried their cinammon buns, didn't like them.  They taste more like apple fritters than cinammon (couldn't taste any cinammon at all ). I'll stick with grocery store cinammon rolls and skip the Winchells.  (they are large, but tasteless and really nor worth all that dough in your stomach!).  Prices are okay.  The other donuts were very ""meh"" and had a somewhat artificial flavor at times.  They seemed fresh so no complaints there.  I just don't care for winchell's flavors or the ""off"" taste or aftertaste  some of their stuff has.  These are the kind of donuts that would  be okay as a breaktime treat for  a bunch of hungry workers who need a sugar fix or a  crowd  of little kids who  love to gobble  dough and sugar washed down with Kool-Aid.

Also, if you're on a budget, the prices won't break your bank like at Krispy Kreme (which I far prefer but can no longer afford).

A few caveats though - 

1) They tend to run out. They will reserve pretzels for you if you call in advance, though.

2) They close way too early. They should be open till at least 7pm - preferably midnight. I can't imagine the post-bar business they could do on Carson St. As it is, you'd better not get a pretzel craving after 3pm or you'll be out of luck.

3) They don't sell chips. If you're the type of person who thinks that sandwiches and chips are made for each other, take the time to stock up on chips elsewhere.

My daughter lived on the Southside and while we were gutting her house and remodeling, I'd stop here every weekend and order our lunches. The sandwiches are KILLER. You haven't lived till you've had the hot dog wrapped in pretzel dough. And for $1.75 you can splurge for a couple and live like a king! The sausage pretzel sandwich heated while you wait so that it's super tasty is another clear winner! So too is the meatball sandwich roll - for $2.45? Are you kidding me??? A great place to get great food (more than pretzels!) at an outrageous price! You'll love it!



Oh yeah, they have pretzels too - flavored ones if you like. How about jalapeno, Cajun, garlic, or parmesan bacon? Spectacular!! But here's a tip, the BEST thing in here is NOT the pretzel. It's the baked goods. Their chocolate gobs are what your mother wishes she could make. Off the chart. Get two - and not to share! You're welcome.",positive

 I've had the chicken club, the veggie pizza, the chicken parm roll (!!!) & even their pasta salad & I've always been satisfied! Their pretzel sandwiches are usually $3.50 (score!!!) & they have all types of variety.. even gyro!



BUT my favorite and choice most of the time would be the breakfast ones! goodness that's perfect even at 2pm. I always make sure to bring Bobby a sandwich home for after work because he can't miss out- it's not fair!

Unfortunately the pretzel sandwiches were disappointing. The have all the sandwiches pre- assembled  in the display case and when you order them they microwave them-- which heat them up but made everything soggy. The sausage in my breakfast sandwich was very salty. We were expecting a family version of Bruegger's Bagel or Panera, well this place is not as good. The price, however, was unbeatable in the Southside area. The two of us had a filling breakfast for under $10 though you do get what you paid for.

Don't get me wrong the Pretzels are good, but it's not life altering in anyway. 



My major beef with this place is their breakfast pretzel. It's like a salty sweet soft pretzel that is meant for breakfast. I think they are kind of gross. They seem to use regular table salt and sugar and the salt over powers the sugar and just tastes like a really salty soft pretzel. Which in my mind is not good for breakfast at all. 



When people at work get them and if I'm really hungry I have to say to myself before taking a bite ""salt...it's going to be salty"" and then take a bit. Else it takes me by surprise every time.

In the fall, I bought soft pumpkin cookies with white icing and they were literally the best pumpkin cookies I've ever had. I walked in the other week and they just had taken out tomato basil pretzels from the oven- oh my goodness... The mozzarella cheese was still melty and the tomatoes were hot- incredible.

The pretzels are VERY salty and typically served cold. So if you're not into that, you're not going to like it. You can't beat the price. I often times find myself craving a pizza pretzel, which I believe is only $1.75. They're so good. It's a small portion, which some people complain about, but what else could you expect with price?

The pretzel ""bread"" of the sandwich was wonderful--very chewy, savory, and delicious.  The fillings, on the other hand, did not impress me--while filling, they were bland and flavorless. The sandwich was also quite messy to eat, since some of the cheese and dressing had leaked out of it, despite its being wrapped up, and continued to leak as I was eating it.  Usually, two napkins is sufficient for me, but this is one of the few times I wish I'd picked up more of them.



In addition to my sandwich, I picked up a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, which, though small, was tasty and full of chocolate chips.  Together, the sandwich and cookie cost a whopping $4.40 (take that, Subway!).  Service was friendly and efficient.

The Pretzel Shop is another Pittsburgh Institution. Made on the premises in large quantities, you can also buy a ton for very little. It makes places like Auntie Anne's look like amateurs. The pretzels taste great, and taste even better when you take home a full bag of 'em to eat later.



The sandwiches I've had here have been enjoyable as well. I usually get the sweet sausage pretzel sandwich or the open faced veggie pretzel. They're both tasty faves and I never had one of either that I felt was not up to scratch. The various cookies and other pastries they sell here are also quite good.



I've never seen The Pretzel Shop not busy. When I've gone in and it's been relatively empty, it only took about ten seconds before there were four or five people behind me.

I've been grabbing food here for around 10 years and have never had a problem.  I'm very picky when it comes to chicken - if there are any ""bits"", I won't be coming back.  But I've always had perfect meat here.  I only recently tried the tofu and while it's not the best, it's still decent.  It's not too chewy and soaks up the sauce but doesn't turn into a sponge.  The General Tso's sauce itself is tangy and, yes, quite greasy.  But sometimes that's just what hits the spot!  You get a choice of steamed or fried rice; I always go with steamed.

We ordered via grubhub's app. I ordered General Tso Shrimp, shrimp fried rice and a small extra white rice. The app offered a coupon so with 2 sodas I met the minimum to add on a free Young Chow fried rice.  Yea! Here comes dinner!



Delivery took a reasonable amount of time. The bag arrived and everything is packaged in Styrofoam. Two things here: 1. Who uses Styrofoam anymore?? it is terrible for the environment and 2. Styrofoam makes everything inside soggy. Yuck. And the sodas arrived warm. I guess they thought we'd like them for later or they are just too lazy to make the cokes cold.



At this point I notice that there are not only zero fortune cookies but zero packets of condiments. My kid was super bummed about the no-cookie bit (me too). Now for the food.



General Tso Shrimp. The shrimp are fried in a heavy batter, like a thick, cheap tempura. Since the batter takes longer to cook it does not take a genius to figure out that the shrimp is so over cooked that if you are lucky it is only just rubbery. Half of them were bone-dry and hard. Yes, they were that over cooked. I included a photo - the shrimp is a the bottom and is so shriveled that it looks just like the gummy tempura batter. Disgusting.  (psst - try this at How Lee - AMAZING)



Shrimp Fried rice. Wow. This was even worse. How they managed to hit both salty and bland is beyond me. The after taste was weird and off. It coated inside your mouth like dirty grease. One bite and the rest in the garbage.



Young Chow Fried Rice. I have had this before from a different place and that place was awesome. This one... and I am not exaggerating... made my daughter cry when I told her that was her dinner. Yes, full tears. I took a closer look and totally got it. I included a photo of it. The pork looks like jerky. I think there was chicken in it, who knows. It looked like vomit. I am not sure I would feed this to a dog it looked so unappetizing. The shrimp looked ok comparatively. No one ate this.



The white rice... yes, the ONE thing EVERY Chinese food place should be able to get right was even dry. Scraped up dry bits from the side and bottom. 



It's been just over an hour - and yeah, I ate some, like an idiot. I was starving. Now I feel sick, that bloaty, nauseous feeling with a slight headache bad food feeling...



Terrible. Just terrible.



edit: 9/3/2014 - the business and I had a colorful back and forth about my review over the weekend and the manager indicated that in order to have a satisfying meal that the diner should only eat in or pick up - that the delivery changes the quality of the meal. 



While I have my own opinions about this it appears that he likely also complained to YELP about my photos (and likely my review) of the meal I was served by his restaurant. these images, most notably, showed a shrimp so completely over cooked that it had shrunk to about 1/3 of its normal size and was swimming inside of the breading. the other image showed dry, unappetizing fried rice. 



What struck me the most about our emails was what I perceived as a complete lack of professionalism and inability to listen to feedback from a customer. Further, if he feels delivery is the issue when why offer it?  To be honest, the delivery was the only thing that met expectation - it arrived within 45 minutes. I have ordered take out from a wide variety of places and have had great meals with it taking even longer to get to me. 



so, bottom line for me? the kid who is managing this restaurant pretty much reinforced my opinion of his business. there are a LOT of options out there in this category and i will happily spend my money at any of those before I spend another penny with this place.",negative
tr868,12/6/2014,revtrain20571,4,"Honestly one of my favorite Asian food joints in Oakland. It's cheap and the portions are huge, so as a college student, it fills all of my expectations. I've gotten their veggie egg rolls a few times and wasn't a huge fan because it was basically filled only with cabbage so I wouldn't get it again. Their tofu dishes are always great- my favorite is General Tso's. Last time I went, they gave me the wrong tofu dish, but that was great, so I'm not too upset about it. 



They're fast, cheap, and conveniently located; I'll definitely go there again.",positive
tr868,1/7/2015,revtrain20572,1,"They were totally rude and when I asked if they can deliver the food 10 minutes earlier, they said no and hung up. Do not order from these people if you expect decent service.",negative
tr869,1/30/2012,revtrain20573,3,"Offers what you'd expect from the Au Bon Pain chain.  Recent changes in how the sandwhich section works are a welcome improvement.  Their breakfast offerings are decent for the prize, while I've also heard their salads are pretty good.



This particular location while not the prettiest does have good employees and tends to manage rush traffic rather well.",positive
tr869,3/3/2013,revtrain20574,3,"There are so many Au Bon Pains to choose from they can't all be gems.  This location just so happens to be my most frequented because it's located in my office building.



I have noticed the bananas lately have been brown.  It's happened twice to where my banana was rotten on the inside.  I like the oj I think it's great but the pastries are not well stocked. To me it seems that no matter when I go in be it early or be it late they're always out of something. 



Au Bon Pain use to have a brie, grapes and cracker offering but I haven't seen it in a really long time. They also use to do a mozzarella with pesto and tomatoes in the little to go container they stopped selling that too.  With Au Bon Pain the quality is failing.",positive
tr869,1/17/2014,revtrain20575,1,"I'm not a huge fan of Au Bon Pain in general, but this one in particular is the worst. I walked in to find every employee on their phone, yelling across the store to eachother. Worse, yet, the entire store, from the door way, smelled of vomit. I made it to the line, but had to turn around as the smell was so pungent. I cannot speak to the product, but I can say, I would never go in there again.",negative
tr869,2/13/2014,revtrain20576,4,Had a Thai peanut and chicken salad. Very good. The only thing I would change is I would add almonds. The dressing was delicious. It was fresh and the service was great. I love au bon pain and even though they're pricey I think it's worth it.,positive
tr869,11/11/2014,revtrain20577,1,"I eat at ABP usually at least twice a week while in Pittsburgh, PA. I usually go to the location down the street, but there is an ABP in 600 Grant St. that I go to for convience. I order the same thing usually, Thai Chicken Salad and recently, I've switched to a different dressing as a substitute. Most locations, either in Pittsburgh or in New York, will just mix Srichacha and BBQ sauce, as requested. The location in 600 Grant St. every time gives me a hard time and berates me for doing so. This is not a difficult or complex request; instead of the Thai Peanut Sauce, just add the BBQ & srichacha sauce. Upon asking for this, I was told ""No."" When I asked why, I was told ""We don't do that."" Upon further inquiry, your staff did not have an adequate response and repeated, ""We don't do that. Other locations SHOULDN'T, and we don't."" This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. If you want to charge me extra for the mixture of sauces, fine. But I was not given this option, instead, I was told flat out ""No."" I am furious that I ever have write such an idiotic complaint, but this is just ridiculous.



Go ahead. See for yourself. If you like the Thai Chicken Salad, and enjoy srichacha and BBQ sauce (it's a great combo), order it and see the ensuring madness.",negative
