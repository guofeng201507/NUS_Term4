WhatsApp has over 120 million users in Brazil, its second-largest market behind India, where it has also struggled to roll out a payments system.If Visa and Mastercard do not comply with the order, they would be subject to fines and administrative sanctions, the statement said.A WhatsApp spokesperson said the messaging service would continue working with \"local partners\" and the central bank to provide digital payments for its users in Brazil using a business model open to more participant, which would address regulators concerns on market concentration.Earlier on Tuesday, before Visa and Mastercard operations with WhatsApp were suspended, the central bank issued regulation saying it could require market participants to receive previous approval to operate in payments.WhatsApp launched its Brazil services without requesting central bank authorization, as it was operating as an intermediary between consumers and financial institutions.Some observers called the regulator's decision an overreaction, while others said WhatsApp presented a potential risk in terms of market concentration and privacy.\"It is a bit odd that the central bank decided to suspend WhatsApp as the regulator is already able to oversee all market participants which joined WhatsApp,\" said Carlos Daltozo, co-head of equities at Eleven Financial. \"Besides that, WhatsApp is open to form new partnerships.\"WhatsApp started its operations in Brazil in partnership with fintech Nubank, state-controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA , Visa, Mastercard and lender Sicredi.In a separate setback for the venture on Tuesday, Brazil's antitrust watchdog, Cade, blocked WhatsApp's partnership with credit and debit card operator Cielo  to process the payments.As Cielo is already Brazil's largest payment processor, a partnership with the biggest messaging service could pose a market concentration risk, Cade said. Shares in Cielo soared 30per cent on the day WhatsApp announced payments service in Brazil.The central bank's move comes as the regulator prepared to launch its own instant payments system in November, called Pix, joining more than 980 participants.\"It is complicated when the regulator also becomes a player and seems to be more worried about its own payment system,\" said a source at a financial institution that has partnered with WhatsApp.The WhatsApp spokesperson said it was committed to working with the central bank to integrate systems once Pix became available.Private banks have also been wary about opening valuable client data to tech giants such as Facebook. Some executives have also pointed to security issues as well as a lack of accountability if a transaction goes wrong.Mastercard said it would comply with the central bank ruling and continue to develop an innovative payment environment.Facebook and Visa did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

President Donald Trump also quickly tweeted that the deal was intact.On Tuesday, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow praised Beijing, telling Fox Business Network \"they've actually picked up their game\" when it comes to the trade deal.The damage-control efforts by the Trump administration come after Trump said last week that \"a complete decoupling from China\" was an option, overruling U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who had told lawmakers that decoupling was not realistic.The Trump re-election campaign has made being \"tough on China\" a key part of his platform (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-election/blame-china-remake-economy-trump-pivots-to-new-election-message-amid-pandemic-idUSKBN22J1GT).

U.S. exports to China rose to US$8.6 billion in April, up from a 10-year monthly trough of US$6.8 billion in February, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Imports from China shot up to US$31.1 billion from US$19.8 billion in March, which marked the lowest monthly total in 11 years.U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed that soybean exports to China rose to 423,891 metric tons in April, more than doubling the 208,505 tonnes imported in March.U.S. officials, including Lighthizer and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have recently affirmed China's commitment to meet the terms of the Phase 1 trade deal, which calls for China to boost purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services by US$200 billion over two years.Lighthizer said last week that about US$10 billion in Chinese purchase commitments had been made under the deal, including US$1 billion worth of cotton.A person familiar with both U.S. and Chinese thinking on the trade deal said that Navarro's comments appeared to be a \"slip of the tongue,\" reflecting his personal hawkish views on China and not administration policy.The person also said that Chinese officials have indicated that June imports from the United States were expected to show a dramatic increase after falls in recent months due to the outbreak.STRONG INVESTMENTU.S. companies had announced US$2.3 billion in new direct investment projects in the first quarter of 2020, only slightly down from last year's quarterly average despite the coronavirus, the Rhodium Group said in a recent study (https://arraysproduction-0dot22.s3.amazonaws.com/rhodiumgroup/assets/icon/TWS-2020_Report_8May2020_Final.pdf) - indicating that U.S. companies are not significantly reducing their China footprint.Bill Reinsch, a senior adviser and trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it took over 20 years for the U.S. and Chinese economies to grow together, and decoupling cannot be accomplished easily.Some companies are leaving, not because of Trump, but because of rising Chinese wage rates and Chinese policies that have disadvantaged foreign-owned businesses, he said.\"If you're in China to serve the Chinese market, you're going to stay because you can't serve it as well from the  outside,\" Reinsch said. \"The president can't simply order everybody to come home.
