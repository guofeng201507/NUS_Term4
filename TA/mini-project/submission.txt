- read in osha.txt
- get text column
- apply getNouns over text column, keep result in a variable like "nouns"

2. Prepare a list of terms for occupations, and one for body parts, using wordNet
occ_words: c(hyponyms("employee"), hyponyms("worker"))
body_words: external body part, body part

3. create corpus from "nouns"

4. create DTM
	- using nouns corpus
 	- in the list of control parameters, dictionary=occ_words
	- use binary indexing method
